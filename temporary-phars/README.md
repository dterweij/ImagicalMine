# New Phar Download System

## Each day that there are new commits, remotevase will attempt to upload a new server phar file!

### It will be uploaded as ImagicalMine_{DATE}.phar

#### When you download the server from the loader branch, you should download this phar as well. Rename it to ImagicalMine.phar and start the server, then you are good!
