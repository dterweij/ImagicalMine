## Windows Powershell Scripts

### Instructions:
1. Make sure that you are using windows
2. Open up Powershell ISE
3. Paste your desired script in to the top box
4. Edit the script to suit your needs
5. Test it by pressing the green arrow in the toolbar at the top
6. If it succeeds, the "last modified" date will have the time that you ran the script
7. Save the file

### Tip for Greater Success:
#### Set run times for each script using Task Scheduler
1. Search for/ Open up Windows Task Scheduler
2. On the "actions" page, create a new action. This is what it should be set to--> Action: Start a Program --> Program/script: powershell --> Add arguements (Optional): -file "{path to the powershell file that you just created}" --> Start in (Optional): {path to the folder that you put the powershell file in}

### Scripts:
1. To download the latest stable build using powershell: 
â‹…
```
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("http://jenkins.terweij.nl/job/ImagicalMine/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releases/ImagicalMine.phar","$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\ImagicalMine.phar")
```
2. To stop the server and restart 2 seconds later:
..
```
cmd /c "$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\forceshutdown.cmd"
Start-Sleep -s 2
cmd /c "$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\start.cmd"
```
3. Backup script
..
```
new-item "$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\backups" -itemtype directory
$a = Get-Date
new-item "$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\backups\$($a.Year)-$($a.Month)-$($a.Day)-$($a.Hour)" -itemtype directory
Copy-Item "$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\*" "$((Resolve-Path .\).Path)\backups\$($a.Year)-$($a.Month)-$($a.Day)-$($a.Hour)" -recurse -Exclude ".git"
```
All credit goes to @Ad5001 for making these script and @remote_vase for the ideas. <!---@remotevase AKA remote_vase and his father for making the future improved scripts together --> <br>
